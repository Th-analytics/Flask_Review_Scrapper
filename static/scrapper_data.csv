Some sample photos which I have transferred to my mobile, are attached here. I am extremely happy with its low light performance. All the photos here are unedited. I was bit confused between M50 and 200d mark II but atlast choosed the later one for its wide variety of lens options.', ""So, The camera comes with a standard lens to get you started. The build quality is great. Feels good in the hand. Lightweight and compact. This comes with the new Digic 8 image processor. And does a fine job out of the box. And editing some photos may also shock you with excellent results. 10/10 Will recommend.  If you're a beginner and looking to stick with a DSLR and grow with it then look no further. I've added 2 of the best photos I took with the stock lens. Used Lightroom to finish it off."", 'Satisfied..!

I am not quite satisfied with it's low-light performance. Both the kit lenses are not that great for low light. You'll either need to increase the ISO sensitivity or the shutter speed and in either ways the image won't be that great.
